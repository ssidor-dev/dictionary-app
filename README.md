# dictionary-app - Front-end Mentor Challenge 
This is the Dictionary web app Front-end Mentor Challenge.
This app was coded using the Figma file provided by [Front-end](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL)
Because this is a premium challenge I did not include the Figma file in this repo.

I learned a lot and had a lot of fun building this app.
Handling the data returned by the API was interesting due to the API sometimes returning multiple items for a word,
phonetics, and audio file. As well as having blank phonetics and audio values.

Your users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts***
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

***I decided not to include this feature, as I thought it clutters the UI, but I may add it as a feature down the line
